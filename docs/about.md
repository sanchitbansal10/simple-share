This is a simple note taking app built with Next.js
The idea is to create a simple note taking app which is fast and simple to use.
It supports wysiwyg editor to write notes.
There is no login
When user opens the app, it creates a note id and redirects to the note page.
Note page has a wysiwyg editor
Notes are saved and synced to backend on regular interval
I am yet to decide the storage solution.
Help me build this!
